# Serving agent data as a localhost dashboard (and getting it onto the user's phone)

## When to Use

Load when the user asks to *see* something the agent already computes, instead of only getting
Telegram messages: "bikin webnya", "atau localhost yg bisa gw akses kyk gitu", "bikin dashboard
dong", "gw mau liat sendiri", "bisa dibuka dari HP ga", or names a product ("zemiztracker") for
such a page.

Typical trigger chain: a CLI tool/monitor was just built (see `third-party-monitor-cloning`) and the
next ask is always "bisa gw akses sendiri nggak?". Answer: **stdlib HTTP server on 127.0.0.1 +
cloudflared quick tunnel + a keeper cron**. No dependencies, no account, no inbound port.

Deliver it BRANDED (title, `/<name>` route, favicon, mobile-app meta) — the user treats this as a
product of theirs, not a debug view. Terse one-word messages like "zemiztracker" mean *name it that*.

## Architecture (4 parts, all cheap)

1. **Server** — Python stdlib `ThreadingHTTPServer`, bound to `127.0.0.1` only (never `0.0.0.0`;
   the tunnel is the only public path). Routes: `/` plus `/<name>` (same page), `/api/<data>` (JSON),
   `/api/refresh` (force), `/healthz`. See `templates/localhost_dashboard_server.py`.
2. **Cache + history** — a daemon thread refreshes the upstream data every `TTL` (60 s) into memory;
   requests never hit the upstream API. Append one JSONL row per refresh (`~/.hermes/data/<tool>_history.jsonl`,
   trimmed to a few hundred lines) so the page can draw a real trend chart instead of a single number.
   Reuse the CLI tool's own functions by loading it with `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location`.
3. **Page** — one self-contained HTML file next to the server (no CDN, no build step, inline CSS/JS),
   rendered client-side from the JSON API with a `fetch` refresh loop. Dark theme, tabular numbers,
   `@media(max-width:620px)` for phone. Put a brand in `<title>` + `<h1>`, an inline data-URI SVG
   favicon, and `theme-color` + `apple-mobile-web-app-*` so "Add to Home Screen" looks like an app.
4. **Exposure + keeper** — `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:<port>` (quick tunnel, no
   account) and `templates/service_keeper.sh` running from a `no_agent` cron every 5–10 min that
   restarts the server/tunnel if dead and **prints the URL only when it changed**.

## Keeper + cron: the no-notification-spam pattern

Quick-tunnel URLs rotate on every restart, so never hand the user a bare URL without a way to learn
the new one. The keeper script is idempotent and does three things:

```bash
curl -sf -m 5 "http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/healthz" >/dev/null || restart_server   # pkill + setsid nohup
pgrep -f "cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:$PORT" >/dev/null || restart_tunnel
URL=$(grep -ho 'https://[a-z0-9-]*\.trycloudflare\.com' "$TUN_LOG" | tail -1)
# write URL to data/<tool>_url.txt; print the message ONLY if it differs from the *_seen.txt copy
```

The `pgrep` line proves a process exists, not that the tunnel works. cloudflared can sit in a
reconnect loop (`ERR failed to serve tunnel connection … Retrying connection in up to 1m4s`) with the
URL already dead, and a pgrep-only keeper stays silent for hours. Gate on the public URL too:
`curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' -m 15 "$URL<route>"`; on a non-200 kill the tunnel and
restart it, accepting the URL rotation rather than keeping a link that 404s.

Register it as `no_agent=true`, `deliver=origin`, `script=<keeper>.sh`: empty stdout = no message, so
the cron is silent on the happy path and only pings the user when the link actually changes. That is
the same delta-only rule as the alert lanes (`cron-output-style`, `hermes-cron-automation`). A second
`no_agent` job runs the data scanner itself on its own cadence.

Restart durability: the detached child must be started **inside the script file** with
`setsid nohup ... >>log 2>&1 </dev/null &`. Do that from the script, not from an agent terminal call.
On hosts where `systemctl --user` fails with "Failed to connect to bus: No medium found" (Hermes
gateway as a system service), script + cron keeper IS the supervisor — don't fight systemd.

**After a host reboot/upgrade, bring lanes back one script per call.** Each keeper script starts a
server *and* a tunnel and waits ~20 s for health, so a loop over four of them blows past the 420 s
tool timeout and you lose which lane failed. Run `timeout 70 bash <script>.sh` per call, then verify
the layer that matters: every port 200 locally **and** every saved tunnel URL 200 publicly. Cron jobs
that logged an error during the boot window (`exit -15`) are not broken jobs — the gateway was still
starting; they reschedule themselves, and the only follow-up needed is re-running a data job whose
slot was missed. Quick tunnels rotate on reboot, so any external webhook pointed at the old hostname is
silently dead: hand the new URL over in the same reply.

## Verify before reporting (all three layers)

1. **Local**: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}'` on `/`, `/<name>`, `/api/<data>`, `/healthz`.
2. **Public**: repeat the same curls against the tunnel URL and assert the real payload — a 200 with
   `size_download` near the file size, and `grep -o '<title>[^<]*</title>'` matching the brand.
3. **Layout in a REAL browser** (best signal — do this whenever the ask is about looks/mobile).
   A Playwright chromium build already exists on this host: binary
   `$HOME/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium-1223/chrome-linux64/chrome` (no `chromium`/`google-chrome`
   on PATH, but this works). Install the driver once into a throwaway venv:
   `~/.hermes/bin/uv venv /tmp/pwenv && ~/.hermes/bin/uv pip install --python /tmp/pwenv/bin/python playwright`
   then `p.chromium.launch(executable_path=<that path>, args=["--no-sandbox","--disable-dev-shm-usage"])`.
   Screenshot at the phone viewport (`viewport={"width":390,"height":844}, device_scale_factor=2,
   is_mobile=True, has_touch=True`, `full_page=True`) and then READ THE IMAGE with `vision_analyze`
   — your model can't see pixels directly, but the vision tool can.
   Measure numerically too, in the same pass: `document.documentElement.scrollWidth` vs `clientWidth`
   (equal = no sideways scroll) and every element whose `getBoundingClientRect().right > vw` (the
   overflow offenders), plus per-row heights of `tr.row`. Copy `scripts/mobile_probe.py` and
   `scripts/mobile_probe_row.py` from this skill.
   Fallback when no browser: run the inline JS under `node` with a DOM stub and print the rendered
   fields (`references/localhost-dashboard-serving.md` has the harness).
   `node --check` on the extracted inline `<script>` is the cheap syntax gate — always run it first.
Then compare the numbers shown against the source dataset one last time — the page is a view, so a
data-parity check is still required.

## Making it actually look good on a phone (and proving it)

Tables are the #1 mobile breakage: a 6-column table with `white-space:nowrap` chips forces its
min-content width past the card, so the WHOLE page scrolls sideways and columns squash/wrap. The fix
that worked (ZemizTracker, 390px): keep the `<table>` markup on desktop and turn each row into a
**grid card** under `@media(max-width:620px)` — never a horizontal scroller.

```css
@media(max-width:620px){
  html,body{overflow-x:hidden;-webkit-text-size-adjust:100%}
  *{-webkit-tap-highlight-color:transparent}
  .hidesm{display:none!important}          /* columns dropped on phone */
  .onlysm{display:inline!important}        /* bits that exist ONLY on phone */
  table,thead,tbody,tr,td{display:block}   /* kill the table box */
  thead{display:none}
  tr.row{display:grid;grid-template-columns:auto 1fr auto auto;
    grid-template-areas:"coin coin coin coin" "px chg net del";gap:5px 10px;padding:10px 12px}
  tr.row td{display:block;border:0;padding:0;text-align:left!important}
  .tw tr.row td:nth-child(1){grid-area:coin}  /* …map each td to an area by nth-child */
  }
```

Rules of thumb that came out of it:
- Map cells to grid areas by `nth-child`; the headers are hidden, so re-add micro-labels with a
  phone-only `<span class="onlysm nl">net </span>` inside the cell.
- Duplicate info you want in two places (e.g. the long/short chips) rather than trying to overlay
  cells — one copy gets `class="onlysm"`, the other stays inside a `class="hidesm"` cell.
- Chips/`white-space:nowrap` are what blow up min-content width. Give them the full row width by
  spanning their cell across all columns; if they must fit a narrow cell, count the pixels first
  (measure `getBoundingClientRect().width` of every chip) instead of guessing.
- Aim for ≤3 lines and ~85px per row (from 138px when it was wrapping), ≤60px on desktop.
- Sticky tab bar (`position:sticky;top:0`) so switching tabs doesn't need a scroll back up; equal
  `flex:1 1 0` on the tabs so they fill the width; `#input{font-size:16px}` so iOS doesn't auto-zoom.
- Header: one line only — shorten badge text with `<span class="hidesm">` (e.g. `54 wallet<span
  class="hidesm"> Hyperliquid</span>`), icon-only refresh button whose label span also carries
  `hidesm`. Watch out: click handlers that rewrite `textContent` must restore the `hidesm` span
  (`b.innerHTML='↻<span class="hidesm"> Refresh</span>'`) and use `event.target.closest('button')`.
- Flat trend charts: if `max-min < 0.2`, draw a **dashed line at mid-height** and label it "stabil"
  instead of a scaled polygon — otherwise the 0-range case renders a fake curve.
- Always screenshot BEFORE and AFTER, stitch them side by side with PIL, and send the image to the
  user (Telegram `MEDIA:` path) — the visual diff is the proof, not prose.

## Pitfalls

- **Wallet/flow graphs: aggregate edges or you ship spaghetti.** 1,000+ raw transfers between ~80
  nodes render as an unreadable bundle (vision-check confirms "spageti"). Three cheap fixes, in order:
  (1) aggregate every `src→dst` pair into one line — sum USD, count `n`, label `$1,2jt ×7`;
  (2) cap what you draw (`sort by usd` → top ~55 pairs; keep the funding-chain `hop-src` links
  unconditionally, dashed) instead of drawing everything above a floor;
  (3) put the floor in the COLLECTOR, not the view, so the JSONL stays clean
  (USDC < ~$1K and HL transfers < ~$10K are dust — token spam like a $500M memecoin to `0x0` also
  has to be filtered by token allow-list).
  Draw edges before nodes (nodes then mask lines crossing them) and give same-lane edges a routed
  bezier so they don't loop through the node boxes.
- **Layered graphs: wrap each depth into lanes.** One column per hop-depth explodes vertically when a
  depth holds 29 nodes (~2,200 px tall inside a horizontal scroller = nested-scroll misery on a phone).
  Chunk each depth into lanes of ~12 (`for(i=0;i<col.length;i+=12) lanes.push(col.slice(i,i+12))`) and
  lay lanes left→right — height caps at ~800 px and the wide scroller stays usable.
- **Trackers adopt `0x000…0` as a "wallet".** A bridge/withdraw destination of the zero address gets
  added like any fresh wallet, and its on-chain "spot" balances are junk (billions of dust tokens).
  Keep an `IGNORE_ADDRS` set in the collector, delete it from state, and remap the zero address to a
  named `jembatan`/bridge node in the view so inflow/outflow still shows.
- **`/healthz` must never build the payload, and must not take the build lock.** In the Zemiz Chain
  board the probe called `payload()`, which rebuilt an 8.7 MB / 7 s payload on a cold cache while
  holding `_lock`; the keeper's `curl -m 5` timed out, killed a healthy server, the restart reset the
  cache, and the loop ran 3,500+ times (visible as a log full of "server jalan di :PORT"). Liveness =
  read two globals and answer in microseconds; data builds belong on `/api/*` or a refresh thread.
- **A TTL cache that rebuilds on the request path stalls every first hit.** A 60 s cache means the
  first request after idle pays the whole build (5 s through a quick tunnel vs 0,3 s warm), which the
  user reports as "lambat/rusak", not as "cold cache". Serve the stale payload and rebuild behind it;
  take the lock only to read the cache and set a `_building` flag, never while `build()` runs:

```python
with _lock:
    d = _cache
    fresh = d is not None and time.time() - _cache_at < 60
    kick = (not fresh) and (not _building)
    if kick:
        _building = True
if fresh:
    return d
if d is not None:
    if kick:
        threading.Thread(target=_rebuild, daemon=True).start()
    return d          # stale now, refreshed seconds later
_rebuild()            # cold start only, when no payload exists yet
return _cache
```

  `_rebuild()` assigns `_cache` / `_cache_at` and clears `_building` in a `finally`, so a failed build
  cannot wedge the flag and leave every request waiting on a cache that never arrives.
- **Unbounded edge logs turn a graph page into a timeout.** 1.05M raw transfer rows made `/api/chain`
  never answer (>2 min) and the JSON 226 MB, because (a) `any(a == e["dst"] for e in edges)` inside a
  per-node comprehension is O(nodes x edges) — precompute `dst_seen = {e["dst"] for e in edges}` — and
  (b) the page aggregates by `src>dst` anyway. Aggregate server-side into one row per pair (`usd` sum,
  `n` count), keep the raw total for the headline stat: 226 MB → 5 MB, 869 KB gzipped, 145 ms.
- **A dedupe function that is never called is not a dedupe.** `insider_chain_build.py` had `prune()`
  and `--prune`, but the refresh path only appended, so 54% of the JSONL was duplicate rows and the
  file grew every 6 h. Call `prune()` at the end of the refresh run (it rewrites the file, ~17 s for
  420 MB → 191 MB) and verify with `wc -l` plus a unique-key count.
- **A silent refresh job hides its own failures.** `no_agent` + empty stdout = no message, so a
  crashed data-builder looks identical to a quiet tick. Capture the child's exit code in the `.sh`
  wrapper and print one line on non-zero — with `deliver=local` for data jobs, so the error lands in
  the local cron output instead of spamming the chat.
- **A service worker registered by ONE page can hijack EVERY page on the origin.** A risk dashboard's
  SW matched `req.mode === 'navigate'` (all navigations) and cached every fetched HTML under the key
  `/risk`; opening the tracker at `/` then showed the cached RISK page, and `/risk`'s cache got
  overwritten with the tracker's HTML. The symptom the user reports is "error / blank" that you CANNOT
  reproduce with curl (server returns 200 every time) because it only happens in the browser holding
  the SW. FIX: scope the fetch handler to the SW's own paths (`if (!RISK_PATHS.includes(pathname)) return;`),
  cache under the requested path, bump the cache name so the old cache is dropped on activate, and serve
  the SW with a short `Cache-Control` (max-age=300) so phones pick the fix up fast. Prove it with the
  offline trick: `ctx.set_offline(True)` then navigate to the OTHER page — with the bug it serves the
  wrong cached page, with the fix it fails normally.
- **Cross-link every page of a multi-page app.** The tracker had no visible link to `/risk` and the risk
  page none back — on a phone that reads as "the link doesn't exist". Add the counterpart link in both
  headers and click-test the round trip.
- **Dict-valued API fields print as `[object Object]`.** If the payload returns `age`/`ttl` as a
  per-section dict, format it (`Object.entries(age).map(([k,v])=>k+' '+Math.round(v)+'s').join(' · ')`)
  instead of concatenating it into a string.
- **Layout: phone cards, desktop 2 columns.** A horizontal table scroller is the #1 mobile breakage —
  render each row as a card (date + total on line 1, per-item chips below). Wrap cards in a `.cards`
  container and switch to `grid-template-columns:1fr 1fr` at `min-width:900px` with the hero card
  `grid-column:1/-1`; a 760px-max single column on a 1280px screen reads as unpolished. Cap chip lists
  (top 6 by absolute value + a `lainnya` residual) so a busy day doesn't wrap to three lines.
- **Label/value pairs must not split across lines on mobile** — wrap each pair in a `white-space:nowrap`
  span, or the label ends one line and its number starts the next.
- **Read the page from disk per request.** Serve the HTML with `open(path).read()` inside `do_GET` (not
  a module-level constant) so you can iterate on the UI without restarting the server each time.
- **The keeper silently stops working after its first restart — flock fd inheritance.** If step 0 does
  `exec 9>lock; flock -n 9` and then launches the server/tunnel with `setsid nohup … &`, the children
  **inherit fd 9** and hold the lock for their whole lifetime. Every later run exits at
  `flock -n 9 || exit 0`, so the keeper can never restart anything again — and never announces a URL
  change (the run that would print it exits first). Symptom: the URL file is stale, the user's saved
  link 404s, and the cron output files all say "silent (empty output)". Diagnose with
  `fuser -v <lockfile>` — if the *server*/*tunnel* PIDs show up, this is it. Fix: close the fd for the
  children — `… >>"$LOG" 2>&1 </dev/null 9>&- &` on both launches (clearing it needs one restart of
  those children, which rotates a quick-tunnel URL). Verify after: `fuser -v <lockfile>` empty, then
  run the keeper twice → second run must be silent.
- **Two keepers sharing one seen-file = the user never gets the new URL.** If a `@reboot`/system
  crontab entry runs the same script with stdout appended to a *log*, it consumes the URL-change and
  writes the seen-file; the Hermes cron run (the one with `deliver=origin`) then sees nothing new and
  stays silent. Give the log-only caller its own watermark via an env override
  (`WHALE_BOARD_SEEN_FILE=…seen.sys.txt`, i.e. make `SEEN_FILE="${VAR:-default}"` in the script) so
  the Telegram-facing keeper stays the one that announces.
- **`pkill -f <script>.py` from an agent terminal call kills your own shell** — the pattern matches
  the shell's own command line (exit `-15`, no output). The bracket trick (`pkill -f "[w]hale_.."`)
  only protects you when that literal text appears NOWHERE else in the command you send: inside a
  heredoc or `python -c` payload that mentions the path (`trade/server.py`), the regex matches your own
  shell and kills the very server you were restarting. The same trap applies to daemons matched by full
  command line (`pkill -f "cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8787"` kills the shell that runs
  it). Safest: keep the pkill inside the keeper script
  file and run it as a script, or resolve the PID from the port and kill that:
  `PID=$(ss -ltnpH "sport = :8790" | grep -oP 'pid=\K[0-9]+' | head -1); kill "$PID"` — the command
  line then never contains the daemon's name at all. Confirm with `pgrep -af "[w]..."`.
- **A live tunnel process can serve a dead URL.** Process-existence keepers report healthy while the
  quick tunnel is stuck reconnecting: `pgrep` matches, the URL file is stale, and every `curl` to the
  old host fails. Diagnose from the tunnel log's tail (`ERR failed to serve tunnel connection`,
  `Retrying connection in up to 1m4s`) and from a real request to the public URL — not from `ps`.
  Kill by PID (`pgrep -af cloudflared` → `kill <pid>`) and rerun the keeper; the URL changes, so hand
  the new one over in the same reply.
- **Long inline shell payloads get hardline-blocked** (parser limit, saved to
  `~/.hermes/cache/blocked-scripts/`). Split into small calls or write a `.sh` file and run that.
- **`patch` in V4A mode can append a duplicated line instead of replacing it** when the context guess
  is loose, and the file then fails with `IndentationError`. Always read back (`read_file` around the
  region) or rely on the tool's own lint result, then fix with `mode=replace` on a unique anchor.
- **Dense snapshots eat the chart window.** A monitor that appends a history row every 15 min fills a
  240-point sparkline with ~2,5 days and pushes the rest off the left edge. Downsample ON READ, don't
  thin the writer: one point per hour, latest per hour —
  `SELECT ts,v FROM t WHERE ts IN (SELECT MAX(ts) FROM t GROUP BY substr(ts,1,13)) ORDER BY ts DESC LIMIT 240`,
  then reverse in Python. Raw rows stay intact.
- **Don't re-verify by grepping the served HTML alone** — the header may render only after JS runs.
  Check the JSON API, then the render harness. Cheap first pass: drive the browser CLI at the tunnel URL
  and read the rendered fields (`document.getElementById('eq').textContent`, the body `innerText`), plus
  a screenshot to send the user — a 200 on `/` proves nothing about JS-rendered content.
- Cache the upstream in memory (TTL) and report in the footer which thresholds/staleness are in
  effect, plus a visible "update berikutnya dalam Ns" countdown, so the user trusts the numbers.
- Optional light gate: token in `?k=` or an `X-Board-Token` header, enabled by env var; leave OFF by
  default for convenience, and say plainly that anyone with the link can view it (public on-chain data
  only — never put the user's own positions/secrets behind a bare quick-tunnel URL).
- Stable URL options to offer when the user wants a permanent name: Cloudflare **named tunnel + own
  domain** (free, needs their CF login), or a `<name>.vercel.app` static page (needs a Vercel token —
  check `~/.vercel` and `.env` first and report what's missing rather than assuming).
